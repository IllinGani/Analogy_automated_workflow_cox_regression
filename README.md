Cox Regression Analysis

Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (Cox_regression.ipynb) performs Cox proportional hazards regression, a statistical technique used to explore the relationship between the survival of a patient and one or more predictor variables. Cox regression is widely applied in medical research to examine how various factors influence survival time.

Contents
	•	Data Preparation: Loading and cleaning the dataset for survival analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data and exploring initial patterns.
	•	Model Fitting: Applying the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of covariates on survival.
	•	Results Interpretation: Visualizing hazard ratios and interpreting model outputs.
	•	Model Diagnostics: Checking proportional hazards assumptions and assessing model fit.

Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	lifelines
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn

You can install these packages using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy lifelines matplotlib seaborn

Usage
	1.	Clone or download this repository.
	2.	Open the notebook using Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Cox_regression.ipynb


	3.	Follow the code cells sequentially to perform Cox regression analysis on your dataset.

Notes
	•	The notebook is structured to handle time-to-event data and can be modified for different datasets.
	•	Ensure your dataset contains variables representing survival time, event/censoring status, and covariates of interest.

Acknowledgements
	•	This analysis builds on concepts from survival analysis and uses the lifelines package for Cox regression modeling.
